// JS Advanced Retake Exam
// Problem 2. OnlineShop
// class OnlineShop {
// 	//TODO Implement this class
// }
// Write a class OnlineShop, which implements the following functionality:
// Functionality
// Constructor
// Should have these 3 properties:
// •	warehouseSpace – Number
// •	products – Array (empty)
// •	sales – Array (empty)
// At the initialization of the OnlineShop class, the constructor accepts the warehouseSpace.
// loadingStore(product, quantity, spaceRequired)
// The product is of type string, while the spaceRequired and quantity are of type number. 
// •	If there is not enough space in the warehouse for the new product, throw an Error:
// "Not enough space in the warehouse."
// •	Otherwise, this function should add the product with the properties: product and quantity to the products array, reduce the space available with the space required by the product, and return:
// "The {product} has been successfully delivered in the warehouse."
// NOTE: Product names will be unique.

// quantityCheck(product, minimalQuantity)
// The quantity is of type number.
// •	If the product is not found, throw an Error:
// "There is no {product} in the warehouse."
// •	If the received minimalQuantity is less than or equal to 0, throw an Error:
// "The quantity cannot be zero or negative."
// •	If the received minimalQuantity is less or equal to the product quantity in the warehouse, return:
// "You have enough from product {product}."
// •	Otherwise, this function should replace the value of product quantity with a minimalQuantity value and return:
// "You added {difference} more from the {product} products."
// •	Difference is the number between the minimum quantity and the product quantity. 

// sellProduct(product) 
// •	If the product is not found, throw an Error:
// "There is no {product} in the warehouse."
// •	Otherwise, this function should decrement by 1 the product quantity from the product in the products array, add it to sales with properties {product} and {1} for quantity, and return: 
// "The {product} has been successfully sold."

// revision()
// This method should return the complete information about the shop: 
// •	If nothing is sold, throw an Error:
// "There are no sales today!"
// •	Otherwise, return how many sales you have:
// "You sold {sales} products today!"
// •	On the second line:
// "Products in the warehouse:"
// •	On the new line, display information about each product in the warehouse:
// "{product}-{quantity} more left"
