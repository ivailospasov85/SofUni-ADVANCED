// // This task is an extension of Problem 1, you may use your solution from that task as a base.
// // You will receive a city’s name (string), population (number), and treasury (number) as arguments, which you will need to set as properties of an object and return it. 
// In addition to the input parameters, the object must have a property taxRate with an initial value of 10, and three methods for managing the city:
// // •	collectTaxes() - Increase treasury by  population * taxRate
// // •	applyGrowth(percentage) - Increase population by given percentage
// // •	applyRecession(percentage) - Decrease treasury by given percentage
// // Round down the values after each calculation.
// // Input
// // Your solution will receive three valid parameters. The methods that expect parameters will be tested with valid input.
// // Output
// // Return an object as described above. The methods of the object modify the object and don’t return anything.
